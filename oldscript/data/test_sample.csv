557;It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening.

957;Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.
958;The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years.
959;"BALTHASAR I brought my master news of Juliet's death; And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument."
960;From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.
961;If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated.
962;She brought me up to Royalties, and people with Stars and Garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and hooked noses.
963;The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.
964;Upon my word, replied Elinor, you know much more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.
965;The victory of the Indians and the annihilation of the ape-men, marked the turning point of our fortunes.
966;THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.
967;They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods.
968;"It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family."
969;He told us of the globe, a huge mass of flaming gas, flaring through the heavens.
970;"Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him."
971;It is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it.
972;Because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man?
973;To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal.
974;On a certain evening, which had been prearranged, I sent my friend final instructions, for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room.
975;"I was sitting near the doorElizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella."
976;[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN walks up and down the room with a troubled expression.
977;But fare you well: perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
978;I'll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.
979;"Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl."
980;I never should have presumed to think of it at first, said she, but for you.
981;He said, with a great show of cheerfulness: I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys.
982;He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.
983;The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts.
984;"The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself."
985;From then onwards, we were in truth masters of the plateau, for the natives looked upon us with a mixture of fear and gratitude, since by our strange powers we had aided them to destroy their hereditary foe.
986;Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.
987;He had only thought it was not the treasure, howeverhe had not known that it wasn'tand so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession.
988;Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever seeexcept one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to him.
989;Finally we set out in the company of the detective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge.
990;So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.

993;"You cannot call it love; for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment Would step from this to this?"
994;"He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as THEIR visitor."
995;Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.
996;Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfnbut we's all right now.
997;"In the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small musical party at her house."
998;"Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account; her daughters might do as they pleased."
999;At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad gypsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while grinning negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums, or turbaned Indians, crouching upon scarlet mats, blew through long pipes of reed or brass, and charmed, or feigned to charm, great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders.
1000;Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main.
1001;"Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham."
1002;That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot what the time was.
1003;"Chapter 54 As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more."

1005;"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Pollywell, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let Sid."
1006;The place was horribly haunted by clouds of mosquitoes and every form of flying pest, so we were glad to find solid ground again and to make a circuit among the trees, which enabled us to outflank this pestilent morass, which droned like an organ in the distance, so loud was it with insect life.
1007;At that moment the muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to lift and wrinkle.
1008;It was greatly my wish that he should do so, he added, as soon as his marriage was fixed on.
1009;"When they came in, t'other was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his remarks."
1010;He couldn't really have stood in front of that brute and lived to draw it.
1011;Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said: I've got it now!
1012;And he wrote as if he really loved her very muchbut she did not knowand so, she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.
1013;However, I shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.
1014;"Second Capulet 'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir; His son is thirty."

1016;He remembered wandering through dimly-lit streets with gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses.
1017;"He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before."
1018;"Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began complaining of the weather."
1019;He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them.
1020;But while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.
1021;A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.
1022;"Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way."
1023;One of the many interesting problems, therefore, which await our solution is to discover what that check may be and how it operates.

1025;He was, I understood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with the embassy.
1026;"Sir John was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in London, was something."
1027;Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness, said Elinor, you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so easily removed.
1028;It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.
1029;Ah, it seems too good to be true, it is too good to be trueI charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me!

1040;Sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach.

1042;"I have heard, said he, with great compassion, of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman."
1043;She must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself.
1044;Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us.

1060;I ain't a-going to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if I was to do that.

1063;As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room.
1064;I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no difficulties at all, to what I used to think.
1065;"Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and says: Alas!"
1066;The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.
1067;"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure, said Bingley; and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."
1068;He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears.

1073;"The promise and the fulfilment differed so widely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it was most tragic or most grotesque."

1075;Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address.

1087;A dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company.
1088;John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply.

1094;He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look at, and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chili, and the sonorous green stones that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness.
1095;They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed.
1096;I needn't tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was.
1097;Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky: SayI'll tell you what we'll do.

1101;I remember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in the heart of Surrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has proved a good deal queerer than I thought.
1102;The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied.
1103;Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeysevidently by the ingenuity of man.
1104;Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.
1105;I am his brother, and, come what will I will die happy now, for his memory has been avenged.
1106;Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.
1107;The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again.
1108;It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to himor at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.
1109;By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on.
1110;"Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours."
1111;But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.
1112;As to the small ruse which I played upon you in the matter of the envelope, it is clear that, had I told you all my intentions, I should have been forced to resist unwelcome pressure to travel out with you.
1113;"Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin; thou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at peace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he shall not find thee, he shall not molest thee."

1115;Beneath its purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean.
1116;Meanwhile, I can see that the Indians are still in their place, and I am sure that the faithful Zambo will be here presently to get my letter.
1117;But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.
1118;I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.
1119;I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced, with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify.
1120;Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall, Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
1121;O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar with rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!
1122;He hoped that he would not hurt the feelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintained that, whatever virtues that gentleman might possess in private life, still the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they were to end entirely in his production.

1131;When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says: Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis trip?

1141;"Young son, it argues a distemper'd head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie; But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art up-roused by some distemperature; Or if not so, then here I hit it right, Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night."

5639;It was his business, however, to say that he DID, and he said it very prettily.
5640;I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.

5743;There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain.

5774;The new boy stepped over promptly, and said: Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.
5775;There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature.
5776;"I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day."
5777;He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found.

5779;In the late afternoon we reached the margin of the lake, and as we emerged from the bush and saw the sheet of water stretching before us our native friends set up a shrill cry of joy and pointed eagerly in front of them.

7149;He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson.
7150;"She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains."
7151;Notill Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had never entered my head.
7152;"Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness."
7153;She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend.
7154;"Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don't work your jaw any between here and there."
7155;Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait, and he started.
7156;"It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.Could it be?No; it was impossible."
7157;"I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug."
7158;But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.
7159;"There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart."
7160;I am very fond of Tommy, but his methods of proposing are quite out of date.

7165;He spent a long time over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence.
7166;As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.
7167;If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement, your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.
7168;"That her sister's affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite of this mortifying conviction."
7169;"Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day."

7171;"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so very wonderful."
7172;"She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears."
7173;"See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out: So by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son."
7174;why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on: and yet, within a month Let me not think on'tFrailty, thy name is woman!
7175;In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.
7176;No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.
7177;"The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing."
7178;I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me to-morrow.
7179;When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with contentment.

7184;"If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me."

7188;What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!He gave his consent with very little persuasion.
7189;There was a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.
7190;Among these he mentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus, seen once by Mr. Malone at a drinking-place by the lake, and drawn in the sketch-book of that adventurous American who had first penetrated this unknown world.
7191;I was so stunned by this sudden shock that for a time I must have nearly lost my reason.
7192;She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival.
7193;But the mulatto's heart was with it, and he was driven back to it next day, when, on reconnoitering through the window, he found policeman Walters in possession.
7194;Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?

7198;At one o'clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcherhim who has the Holland Grove beatand we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin'.

7200;And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William: Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.
7201;He was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life.
7202;It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood does not wish it.
7203;"Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't quite approve of your being here."
7204;But I was really quite shocked the other dayfor Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock.

7218;"said Lydia stoutly, I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest."

7230;"Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty."

8824;"This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure."
8825;"But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her."

8831;"Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see."
8832;"Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report."
8833;"It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr. Weston went on."
8834;"The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says: That 'll fix it."
8835;"His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness, and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation."
8836;Miles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before her.

8850;He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says: Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks.
8851;Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.
8852;I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water.
8853;He thanked her, observing, How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment!
8854;Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eyethat the whole blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?
8855;"Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself."

8859;"So for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says: I'd ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to."
8860;The entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a remarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and cheering for some minutes.
8861;"HAMLET No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?"
8862;Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds.
8863;Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.

8869;His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.
8870;Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious wayas became outlaws.
8871;"Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible."
8872;And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.
8873;"HERMIA And in the wood, where often you and I Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie, Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, There my Lysander and myself shall meet; And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, To seek new friends and stranger companies."

8878;He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a pale face.

8883;When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?
8884;We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog.
8885;Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.
8886;Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business.

8894;The next, there was a crash in the underwood and our dreadful visitor was gone.
8895;The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.
8896;A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the color came back to his cheeks.
8897;Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.
8898;There warn't any signs of the bar at the headit was all under water now.
8899;Then he pictured the solidification, the cooling, the wrinkling which formed the mountains, the steam which turned to water, the slow preparation of the stage upon which was to be played the inexplicable drama of life.
8900;"I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare."
8901;Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in.
8902;The thick vegetation met overhead, interlacing into a natural pergola, and through this tunnel of verdure in a golden twilight flowed the green, pellucid river, beautiful in itself, but marvelous from the strange tints thrown by the vivid light from above filtered and tempered in its fall.

8909;Now he was pale and wild-eyed, gasping as he breathed like one who has run far and fast.
8910;"Emma scarcely heard what was said.Her mind was divided between two ideasher own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and poor Harriet;and for some time she could only exclaim, and require confirmation, repeated confirmation."
8911;But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence.

8918;"I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watsonthey could kill her."
8919;I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late.
8920;Now, what you did see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  PBWand he marked them that way on a piece of paper.

8928;"said Miss Bates, joyfully; my mother is so pleased!she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress."
8929;A sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up a chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!
8930;Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
8931;They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody elseat least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.
8932;"She had heard, as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage."
8933;I call them apes, but they carried sticks and stones in their hands and jabbered talk to each other, and ended up by tyin' our hands with creepers, so they are ahead of any beast that I have seen in my wanderin's.
8934;Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun.
8935;I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.

8937;I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me,if we had not kissed each other.
8938;He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another, said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be angry.
8939;MERCUTIO I mean, sir, in delay We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
8940;When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.
8941;He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him.
8942;On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada.
8943;"It might be a very indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in itand so did Frank and Harriet.It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said, This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body else."

8955;"Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman."
8956;Elinor's office was a painful one.She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister's chief consolation,to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations, which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment over again.

8966;The matter has ended in reprimands, the opponents have been compelled to shake hands, and there is every hope that all will be well.
8967;There I settled into a convenient fork, and, balancing myself securely, I found myself looking down at a most wonderful panorama of this strange country in which we found ourselves.
8968;They came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining him minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of animal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he might be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion.

8973;"Egeus, I will overbear your will; For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit: And, for the morning now is something worn, Our purposed hunting shall be set aside."
8974;"Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; But, better look'd into, he truly found It was against your highness: whereat grieved, That so his sickness, age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty."
8975;He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them.
8976;He had been always enthralled by the methods of science, but the ordinary subject-matter of science had seemed to him trivial and of no import.

8981;"Marianne would not let her proceed;and Elinor, satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject, immediately continued, One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the storythat all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams."
8982;"His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied, You are too good."
8983;We ran forward into the open to meet our friends, and pressed a loaded rifle into the hands of each.

8985;"FRIAR LAURENCE Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift."
8986;"But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still improved them."
8987;He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim lad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose clothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of black,doublet, hose, and all.
8988;But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.

8991;I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp.

8993;But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.
8994;"I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says: He's white."
8995;Their dark, angry glances at the woods from which we had come, and the frequent repetition of the word Doda, made it clear enough that this was a rescue party who had set forth to save or revenge the old chief's son, for such we gathered that the youth must be.
8996;Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of itbut there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast.
8997;Up this I climbed, and, lying on the top, I had an excellent view in every direction.
